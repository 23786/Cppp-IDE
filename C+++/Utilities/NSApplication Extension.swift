            1. Why does the app always crash?
            If the application always crashes, please delete all files at path \"~/Library/C+++\" and restart the app. If the crash still happens, please create an issue at GitHub repo: \"https://github.com/23786/Cppp-IDE\".
            
            2. How to install C++ Compiler?
            C++ Compiler is not included in the C+++ app. You need to install it.
            Open \"Terminal\" and type g++, press enter. A dialog will appear. Follow the instructions and install the commane line tools. Or you can directly compile a file in C+++ and that dialog will appear too.
            If you have already installed it or installed Xcode, you needn't install g++ again.
            
            3. Why I can't use \"bits/stdc++.h\"?
            That's because you are using macOS, and that header file is not available in macOS.
            
            4. Why I can't use \"windows.h\"?
            You are using macOS. Don't dream of using windows.h in Mac!
            
            5. The app displays a lot of error codes when openning a document.
            Maybe you are openning a file which was previously edited in Windows or other operating systems which do not follow the UTF-8 encoding. The default encoding of the document is UTF-8 in C+++ (which is also the default one in macOS). If the document openning operation fails, the app will try WindowsCP1252 encoding. Otherwise Unicode.

            6. Code Diagnostic: Fatal: 'xxx' file not found.
            Sorry, this is a bug. We can't solve that now, but we will continue to work out solutions to this issue.

            7. I use freopen() in my main program, but it doesn't work.
            Sorry, this is also a bug. Workaround: Create a input file at path \"/Users/{Your Username}/\" and execute the file. Then you will see the output file at the same directory.
