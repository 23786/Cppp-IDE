# C+++ IDE for Mac

----

**C+++** is a simple C++ IDE for macOS. It's for **OI (Olympics in Informatics, 信息学奥赛) / Competitive Programming** learners to use. It's a little like _Dev-C++_ on Windows(which a lot of OIers use) but it is much easier to use.

It is developed by a Grade-Seven student @23786.

**Note: Version 3.0 is being developed, but because it is a large update, so developing takes a lot of time. But **_do not install version 2.1_**, it is really unstable.**

So if you want to use C+++, the best choice is to **wait** until the version 3.0 is released.

**文化课原因，开发进展极慢，周末也不一定有时间写代码，现在在主分支里的代码编译后有很多 bug 待修 / feature 待实现，非常不建议使用。**

**现在开发进度卡在 LSP 这里，还没有搞清楚如何高效应用在编辑器上。**

## Install g++
- Open terminal, and type "g++", press enter, and there should be a dialog box "Install Xcode g++", install it, about 2~5 minutes later the installation process will be completed and then you can use C+++.
- Of course, you can choose your compiler. You can choose between g++, gcc and clang. You can also set the compiler to "python", "swift" or other compilers, but that is not recommended. -->
