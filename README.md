> C+++ is an open source C++ IDE on macOS Platform, which is for C++ learners to use. Supports Dark Mode and Touch Bar. You needn't create a Xcode project to compile C++ file or compile a C++ file in the Terminal, all the things are done in the C+++ App.

## The best C++ IDE on macOS for beginners
- Developed by a Grade-Six student 23786.

## Uses the Xcode g++ to compile
- Open terminal, and input "g++", press enter, and there should be a dialog box "Install Xcode g++", install it, about 2~5 minutes later the installation process will be completed and then you can use C+++.
- Of course, you can choose your compiler. You can choose between g++, gcc and clang. You can also set the compiler to "python", "swift" or other compilers, but that is not recommended.
