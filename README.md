# C+++ IDE for Mac

----

**C+++** is a simple C++ IDE for macOS. It's for **OI (Olympics in Informatics, 信息学奥赛)** learners to use. It's a little like _Dev-C++_ on Windows(which a lot of OIers use) but it is much easier to use.

It is developed by a Grade-Seven student @23786.

## Note: Version 3.0 is being developed, but because it is a large update, so developing takes a lot of time. The new version will not be released until **macOS 11.0 Big Sur** is released. But **do not install version 2.1**, it is really unstable.

## So if you want to use C+++, the best choice is to **wait** until the version 3.0 is released.
