# **<font color = "#000000">A lightweight and modern C++ IDE on macOS Platform</font>**
## Developed by a Grade-Six (now seven) student _23786_.

> C+++ is an open-source C++ IDE on macOS Platform for C++ learners to use. It supports Dark Mode and Touch Bar. You needn't create a Xcode project to compile C++ file or compile a C++ file using the g++ command in the Terminal, all works are done in the C+++ App.

----

# **Write Code, Compile, Run.**

Though C+++ IDE doesn't have as much function as Xcode and Visual Studio have, though it is not as professional as Dev-C++ on Windows, but it is really enough for a C++ Beginner who aims to attend the OI competitions. C+++ Includes the most basic features, such as code editing, compiling, debugging. It also provides more user-friendly interface for users.

# **Perfect UI with Perfect Stability.**

C+++ supports syntax highlighting, Dark Mode and Touch Bar, and it includes clean User Interface, with no unnecessary elements on the view which will bother you when you are coding. If you still think the UI is too complicated, you can also enter the simple mode, which you can only see the code editor. C+++ also has perfect stability, few crash can occur.

# **Have fun with Code Completion and Realtime diagnostic.**

Two of the important features in C+++ is Code Completion and Realtime Diagnostic. Code Completion helps you type code more efficiently, while Realtime Diagnostic helps you find out errors in the code right when you are typing it. Enjoy coding with these two functions!

# **Code Snippet is also here.**

Code Snippet is a small portion of re-usable source code. They allow you to avoid typing repetitive code during programming. In C+++, this feature is also here. Click the second button on the left sidebar, then you can add snippets into your source code.
