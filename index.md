> C+++ is an open-source C++ IDE on macOS Platform for C++ learners to use. It supports Dark Mode and Touch Bar. You needn't create a Xcode project to compile C++ file or compile a C++ file using the g++ command in the Terminal, all works are done in the C+++ App.


# **Write Code, Compile, Run.**

Though C+++ IDE doesn't have as much function as Xcode and Visual Studio have, though it is not as professional as Dev-C++ on Windows, but it is really enough for a C++ Beginner who aims to attend the OI competitions. C+++ Includes the most basic features, such as code editing, compiling, debugging. It also provides more user-friendly interface for users.
